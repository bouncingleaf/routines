Running this application:

I was able to run this application in one of two ways:

1. From IntelliJ, using the Run function on the RoutinesApp class
2. From the command line, in the routines\routines\bin folder:
   java jmroy.RoutinesApp

Interacting with the application:

1. You will be prompted for your "name", you can use any string or hit
   enter to use a default (it will call you "friend")
2. The List routines and Run a routine options will just display
   "No routines found" until you enter at least one routine, so you
   may want to start with option 1.
3. Enter an arbitrary string for the name of your routine.
4. You can have a routine with no tasks, but that isn't very interesting,
   so go ahead and enter a few tasks.
5. When you're done entering tasks, just hit enter when it prompts you
   for the name of the next task.
6. Once you have a routine entered, you can view all the routines, or
   "run" a specific routine. ("Run" is a dummy method for now.)
7. Choose 0 at the main menu to exit.
